# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current AI协作能力PPT presentation has grown to 1466 lines in a single index.html file with only 21 pages, making it difficult to maintain and scale. This feature aims to refactor the monolithic HTML structure into a modular architecture where each major section of the PPT is separated into its own HTML file, with a main index.html that orchestrates the loading and navigation between modules.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This modular architecture supports maintainability, scalability, and developer productivity by implementing clean separation of concerns for the AI collaboration skills presentation system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each PPT section to be in separate HTML files, so that I can maintain and update individual sections without affecting the entire presentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PPT is loaded THEN the system SHALL load content from separate module files
2. WHEN a user navigates between sections THEN the system SHALL seamlessly transition between different HTML modules
3. WHEN a module is updated THEN only that specific section SHALL be affected without breaking other parts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a main index.html that orchestrates module loading, so that I can control the overall presentation flow and navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the presentation starts THEN index.html SHALL load and initialize the module system
2. WHEN navigation occurs THEN index.html SHALL handle transitions between modules
3. WHEN fullpage.js is initialized THEN it SHALL work seamlessly across all loaded modules

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modules organized by logical sections, so that I can easily locate and modify specific content areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules are created THEN they SHALL be organized by content themes (introduction, legal-scenarios, creative-applications, medical-applications, conclusion)
2. WHEN a module contains multiple pages THEN they SHALL be logically grouped within that module
3. WHEN page numbering is applied THEN it SHALL be consistent across all modules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the same presentation experience, so that the modular architecture doesn't affect functionality or performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all controls SHALL work identically to the current system
2. WHEN using page indicators THEN navigation SHALL work seamlessly across modules
3. WHEN animations play THEN they SHALL function the same as the monolithic version

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module file should contain only pages related to its specific content theme
- **Modular Design**: Modules should be independently loadable and not depend on each other's internal structure
- **Dependency Management**: Shared CSS, JavaScript, and assets should be referenced centrally
- **Clear Interfaces**: Module loading and page counting interfaces should be well-defined

### Performance
- Module loading should not significantly impact initial page load time
- Navigation between modules should be smooth and responsive
- Memory usage should not increase substantially compared to monolithic version

### Maintainability
- Each module should be under 300 lines of HTML for easier maintenance
- Module file naming should clearly indicate content and page ranges
- CSS and JavaScript should remain centralized to avoid duplication

### Reliability
- Module loading failures should not crash the entire presentation
- Page counting and navigation should work correctly across module boundaries
- Fallback mechanisms should exist for missing or corrupted modules
